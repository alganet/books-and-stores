# Books and Stores

A simple CRUD made with Laravel

Notes:

 - Typical Laravel Sail setup.
 - Laravel Sanctum for authentication. Check `AuthTest` for more info.
 - I used repositories to encapsulate more elaborate queries, trivial ones
   such as find/delete and model creation are done by standard Eloquent.
 - A more elaborate repository pattern could evolve (interfaces, standards around
   naming, etc) or something like Laravel Actions.
